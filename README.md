# Loan-Risk-Analysis
This project aims to give us an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this project, apart from applying EDA techniques , we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
